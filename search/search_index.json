When it comes to the naming conventions of a single RPM file, Red Hat uses the NEVRA convention that follows the <code>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;epoch&gt;:&lt;version&gt;-&lt;release&gt;.&lt;architecture&gt;.rpm</code> file name pattern, for example <code>emacs-27.2-9.el9.x86_64.rpm</code>. For more information about RPM packaging conventions, see the RPM Packaging Guide</p> <p>Representing this information in a purl presents a few challenges because the purpose of the purl specification is to not only identify a particular package (the file name already does that) but also the location from where the package can be accessed. The emacs package example above can be represented using the following purl:</p> <pre><code>pkg:rpm/redhat/emacs@27.2-9.el9?arch=x86_64&amp;repository_id=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms\n</code></pre> <p>The namespace value of <code>redhat</code> signifies this as an RPM package produced and distributed by Red Hat. This value also differentiates packages available in Red Hat repositories from those that could potentially share the same name, version, and repository name but were provided by a different vendor.</p> <p>If a purl identifies a Source RPM (SRPM, a package containing source code files that are used to build one or more RPMs containing binary artifacts), the <code>arch</code> qualifier must use the special value <code>src</code>. In the NEVRA file name pattern, SRPM packages use a <code>.src.rpm</code> suffix. Packages that are not architecture-specific must use the special <code>noarch</code> value in the arch qualifier. Binary RPM packages will include a specific architecture as shown in the example above, or will omit the <code>arch</code> qualifier entirely to signify that the identifier applies to all available architectures.</p> <pre><code>pkg:rpm/redhat/emacs@27.2-9.el9?arch=x86_64  # Binary RPM package for the x86_64 architecture\npkg:rpm/redhat/emacs?arch=src  # SRPM package that identifies all available versions of the emacs package\npkg:rpm/redhat/emacs  # Binary RPM package that identifies all available versions and architectures\n</code></pre> <p>An RPM package may also include an epoch number; if not present, it is assumed to be <code>0</code>. In a purl, epoch is not part of the version field, but instead is specified using the <code>epoch</code> qualifier (e.g. <code>epoch=1</code>). If the package version includes a non-zero epoch value, it must be specified using its own epoch qualifier:</p> <pre><code>pkg:rpm/redhat/emacs@27.2-9.el9?epoch=1&amp;arch=src&amp;repository_id=rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>rpm</code> purl type suggests the use of the <code>repository_url</code> qualifier to point to the base URL of the RPM repository from where the RPM can be downloaded. We are purposefully not using the <code>repository_url</code> qualifier in Red Hat purls because the base URL can vary depending on whether packages are sourced from Red Hat-hosted repositories (at cdn.redhat.com), local Red Hat Satellite-mirrored repositories, or Cloud provider-hosted repositories. Instead, Red Hat purls use a <code>repository_id</code> qualifier that identifies the repository from which the package can be downloaded using YUM or DNF.</p> <p>The repository ID is a unique value that identifies an RPM repository from where RPM packages can be fetched. If the ID of the repository is the same and the other attributes of the RPM match, such packages even though sourced from varying URLs can be considered the same for the purposes of simple identification. Given a repository ID, you can resolve it to a URL using your chosen base URL and a relative path of that repository that exists in the repository-to-cpe.json mapping file. This file maps repository IDs to both relative URL paths and CPE IDs that represent product versions in all of Red Hat's security data files.</p> <p>Another qualifier defined for the <code>rpm</code> purl type is <code>distro</code>, which is an arbitrary value that describes the Linux distribution that the package is included in. The <code>distro</code> qualifier is not recommended to be used for Red Hat RPMs because its values are not standardized and may, depending on how the value is interpreted, inaccurately identify a package as being specific to a particular version of a distribution even though it may be available in multiple distribution versions.</p>"},{"location":"purl/#identifying-rpm-modules","title":"Identifying RPM modules","text":"<p>RPM modules allow grouping a set of RPMs to represent a single component.

In some cases you may want the address for a single person with its name, or the whole household. If someone is off the grid in the bayou or some isolated mountain, crafting a proper address may be more hairy and fuzzy. Worst case I may need GPS coordinates for these edge cases.

Key improvements include:</p> <ul> <li>Improved Product Granularity: Currently, unfixed products are only represented at the major version (RHEL 9). The new version of VEX files will explicitly list affected supported streams (RHEL 9.6, RHEL 9.4 EUS, RHEL 9.2 EUS, etc.). Simplified Product Trees: Removing inconsistent branch nesting for \u2018architecture\u2019 and \u2018product_family\u2019 branches to simplify the product tree structure. We are also removing redundant architecture representation for components and duplication of product variants to reduce the total number of product entries.</li> <li>Enhanced Validation: Better validation for CSAF VEX formats and identification helpers like CPEs and PURLs</li> <li>Consistency Fixes: Standardized product \u2018name\u2019 and \u2018product_id\u2019 formats to ensure consistency between \"fixed\" and \"unfixed\" statuses.</li> <li>Streamlined Content: We\u2019ve removed unrequired fields (duplicate titles, redundant CVSS scores, unnecessary note objects) and ensured \u2018fixed\u2019 product and components no longer appear in \u2018workaround\u2019 remediation objects.</li> <li>Modernized Infrastructure: We have migrated VEX publication to a completely new service that improves performance and supportability. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"vex-alpha/#alpha-limitations-known-issues","title":"Alpha Limitations &amp; Known Issues","text":"<p>As we perform final data cleanup and address some remaining functionality, you may notice daily fluctuations in file content.
