# Red Hat Security Data
This site is intended to provide both Red Hat customers and partners with a set of documents detailing Red Hat's 
publishing of security data. 

## Red Hat Security Data History 
The Red Hat Product Security was originally founded in 2001 and has always been committed to providing our customers
and partners with complete and accurate security data for all Red Hat software. In the past, Red Hat published security
advisory information using Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) and CVE information using the Open
Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) format. Over the last few years, the Common Security Advisory Framework
(CSAF) 2.0 standard was published and is now the successor to the CVRF version 1.2 as there are many enhancements to the
information provided in each CSAF file.

On February 1st, 2023, Red Hat first announced the general availability of CSAF 2.0 documents. This version of our CSAF
files are published using the VEX profile (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) and the document type is now known as
csaf_vex. Since then Red Hat has continued to make improvements to our published security data, including the GA release
of our VEX files on July 10th, 2024. While publishing our CSAF files was extremely helpful for correlating security data
to individual advisories, we began publishing VEX files to make it easier for our partners and customers to correlate
both fixed and unfixed security information to an individual CVE. Additionally, the publication of our VEX files
announced the deprecation of our previously published OVAL data, which did not provide the same level of detailed
security information.

Currently, Red Hat Product Security publishes CSAF files for every single Red Hat Security Advisory
([RHSA](https://access.redhat.com/articles/explaining_redhat_errata)) and VEX files
for every single CVE record that is associated with the Red Hat portfolio in any way.
