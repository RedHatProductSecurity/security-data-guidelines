# Technical Guidance for Vulnerability Scanning Vendors

## Certification Overview 
The Red Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification is a collaboration with security partners to deliver more accurate and 
reliable container vulnerability scanning results of Red Hat products and packages. Security partners can now consume 
and leverage Red Hatâ€™s extensive and evolving set of published security data to minimize customer false positives and 
other discrepancies.

For more detailed information on the program please see the [Partner Guide for Red Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-red-hat-vulnerability-scanner-cert)
